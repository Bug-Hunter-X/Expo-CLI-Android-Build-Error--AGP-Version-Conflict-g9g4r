This error occurs when using Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves an issue with the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) version compatibility.  The error message might mention a version conflict or incompatibility between the AGP version used by Expo and the one specified in your project's `android/build.gradle` file.  Sometimes, the Expo CLI may not automatically manage the AGP version correctly, resulting in a build failure.
