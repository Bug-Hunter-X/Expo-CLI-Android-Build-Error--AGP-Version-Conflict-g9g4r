The solution involves updating the AGP version in the `android/build.gradle` file to a version that's compatible with both Expo and your project's dependencies.  Refer to Expo's documentation and the AGP release notes for compatible versions.

Here's an example of how to correct the `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
buildscript {
    ext.kotlin_version = "1.8.22"
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath("com.android.tools.build:gradle:8.1.0") // Updated AGP version
        classpath("org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version")
    }
}

// ... rest of the build.gradle file
```

Make sure to clean and rebuild your project after making changes to the `build.gradle` file.  Use the commands `expo prebuild` and then `expo run:android`.
